Quiz Game

# Description
Creating a game with Javascript that keeps score for a user while also counting down the timer.  If a user gets a question incorrect they are hit with a penalty that reduces the time left for their quiz.  If the user completes the quiz they are able to enter their name in for a high score to be captured.


## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
